=head1 ABOUT

caldav-import - fetch remote calendars and push them to your CalDAV server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 caldav-import <config_file>

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration file is a plain text file based on the ini file format. It has sections
and key-value pairs (key=value). The config has two sections named [caldav] and [feeds].

[caldav] contains the destination "url" where the calendars have to be pushed to,
as well as "username" and "password".

[feeds] can contain multiple key-value pairs. The key describes the destination calender
under the destination URL (the calendar will be completely overwritten) and the value
is the address of the remote calendar:

 cal_name_1 = http://some.server.com/calendar.ics
 cal_name_2 = http://some.other.server/caldav.php/public

See config.sample for a template
